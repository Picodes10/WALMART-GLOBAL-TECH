# Walmart USA Advanced Software Engineering Virtual Internship

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for my projects completed as part of the **Walmart USA Advanced Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program** on Forage in November 2024. This program provided me with the opportunity to tackle challenging, real-world technical problems similar to those faced by Walmart’s engineering teams. Through these projects, I demonstrated problem-solving skills, deepened my understanding of data structures, and applied advanced software design principles.

## Projects

### 1. **Power of Two Max Heap**
   - **Objective**: Develop a unique max-heap data structure in Java for Walmart’s shipping department, tailored to handle complex data storage and retrieval operations efficiently.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Implement a max-heap that satisfies the heap property and has `2^k` children per node, where `k` is a configurable parameter.
     - Build efficient `insert` and `pop max` methods to optimize performance for high-volume data processing.
   - **Skills Highlighted**: Java programming, custom data structure design, algorithmic problem-solving, and performance optimization.

### 2. **UML Class Diagram for Data Processor**
   - **Objective**: Design a UML class diagram for a data processing system with multiple operating modes and database configurations.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Define a processor architecture that can dynamically switch between operating modes (Dump, Passthrough, Validate) and connect to various databases (Postgres, Redis, Elastic).
     - Ensure the design is extendable for additional modes and databases.
     - Apply design patterns (e.g., Strategy, Abstract Factory) and SOLID principles to make the system modular and maintainable.
   - **Skills Highlighted**: Object-oriented design, UML modeling, application of design patterns, clean code principles.

### 3. **Entity Relationship Diagram for Pet Department Database**
   - **Objective**: Create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a new database in Walmart's pet department, covering key requirements for efficient data management.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Analyze and capture requirements for managing pet inventory, customer information, and purchase tracking.
     - Design an ERD with well-defined relationships and constraints to ensure scalability and performance.
   - **Skills Highlighted**: Database design, ERD modeling, relational database management, requirement analysis.

## Key Takeaways

This experience provided valuable insights into the challenges of large-scale data management, efficient algorithm design, and extendable system architecture. Each project in this repository underscores my capabilities in software design, system architecture, and data modeling, preparing me to contribute effectively to advanced software engineering roles.

## Technology Stack
